*A tutorial from Rey Bango*

What a great tutorial for Emberjs.
Now that Ember has reached it's release, it is much more enjoyable to
work with. stuff works when it's suppose too. All too often in the past
I would be working on a tutorial and in the middle of it, the app would
break due to the fact that the author was using a dated version of
Emeber. Now that Ember is more stable, I am able to do a tutorial and
have it work. oh joy!
